# Crave Backend

## Description
This is the backend to my app "Crave" it works by connecting to a mongodb database to keep track of Crave game sessions and also recognizes a winning scenario. To sync the connections of multiple devices I used Socket.io and kept track of the game state through sockets.

## Installation
To run the backend download the dependencies using `yarn` and then start the server using `yarn run` make sure you have a mongodb session running on your server computer at the same time.
